# pyosmoctrl
A Python module that aims to simplify interaction with the Osmocom Control Interface.

I found the Osmocom Control Interface to be difficult to understand and work with, 
mainly due to a lack of direct tooling intended to interact with it.

I decided to make this Python module to get a better understanding of the protocol, 
and to allow me to quickly iterate and make further tooling using the CTRL interface.
